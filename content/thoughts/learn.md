i have always wanted to keep learning plenty of things, not only about tech, and i do have a long list of things to learn. But if I had to summarize it to a few points, i think they would be:

- How can AI be developed to align with human ethics and morals?
- Economics and its related fields
- Human evolution and human brain
- Philosophy
- Cybersecurity
- Blockchain/crypto 

if you have any helpful articles, videos, recommendations, books, etc., please share them with me thxs.
